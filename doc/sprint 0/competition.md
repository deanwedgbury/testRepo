www.edyn.com


HOW is our product different

no ours will water without wifi we just need a timer
which deps on data?
after u check moisture levels
since we cant connect to wifi to know when to water
ours cheaper
edyn is only outdoors cuz they use a solar panel 
also its big
ours is modular

Scneario1:
our product is better for the scenario tht the plant is indoor
in home casual users

edyn didnt focus on these cuz theyre targeting gardens while ours is for single potted plants

for edyn to focus on these things, theyd have to rethink theyre power source
consumers have to buy multiple components so its for more serious people not beginners

scenario2:
another scenario is for ppl who just want to get into plants
