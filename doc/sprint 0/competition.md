EDYN - https://edyn.com/
  - automatically measures and waters outdoors gardens based on a database of over 5000 plants
  - connects to an outdoor hose
  - powered by solar
  - measures light, moisture, nutrition and humidity
  
How we differ:
   - EDYN must be connected to the internet at all times, our product has an offline backup which will still water plants based on    sensor data and time intervals in case the internet is disconnected
   - EDYN only works in outdoor gardens, our product is designed for indoor, single-potted plants
   - EDYN is powered by solar and does not have a water reservoir, our product will have a water reservoir and it will be powered by a battery or wall outlet
   - without accessories, the EDYN is $99.9, our product will be significantly cheaper
   
   
   
Why they differ:
    - EDYN is targeting a similar, but different demographic. EDYN is aiming at people with outdoor gardens who want to have some of maintanence automated, while we focus on individuals with indoor plants that want to track and maintain their plants when they aren't necessarily available or capable
    - EDYN is focued on garden enthusiasts while we focus on any plant lover, including novices
    
    
ZipGrow - https://zipgrow.ca/
    - tall vertical towers which automate watering and light source
    - very minimal interaction required once it's set up
    - can be found in the UTM Student Centre
    
    How we differ:
    - the ZipGrow system is focused on commercial use or more advanced consumer use, our product is designed for any regular consumer with a potted plant
    - it does not connect to the internet and does not have any sensors, our product will track various plant data and relay that information online
    - it cannot be used on existing plants, you have to start from scratch, our product can be used on existing pots or on new ones
    - since the ZipGrow is a vertical tower, it can only be used for specific produce, particularly smaller leafy plants, our product has can be used on any plant that can grow in a a pot
    - the cheapest ZipGrow tower is $79.99 and it does not include the automatic watering system, our product will be significantly cheaper

www.edyn.com


HOW is our product different

no ours will water without wifi we just need a timer
which deps on data?
after u check moisture levels
since we cant connect to wifi to know when to water
ours cheaper
edyn is only outdoors cuz they use a solar panel 
also its big
ours is modular

Scneario1:
our product is better for the scenario tht the plant is indoor
in home casual users

edyn didnt focus on these cuz theyre targeting gardens while ours is for single potted plants

for edyn to focus on these things, theyd have to rethink theyre power source
consumers have to buy multiple components so its for more serious people not beginners

scenario2:
another scenario is for ppl who just want to get into plants
