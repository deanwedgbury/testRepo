## Organization
- We have chosen to organize tasks and roles by interest and skills. This decision was made by consensus during an in person meeting.
An example of the role assignment is: members who have experience working with Arduinos will initially begin by focusing on the Arduino
programming component.
- Sprint 0 tasks were written on a whiteboard during a meeting and had been split up and assigned to members. A picture of the whiteboard
had been sent to the team group chat for record keeping. Tasks were assigned to suit each team member's strengths and a deadline was set
for Monday **January 29, 2018**. 

## Decision Making
- All key decisions were made democratically. When individuals brought up decisions, each person contributed their solution and the outcome
was decided once everyone had voiced their opinions and agreed.

## User Story Priority/Points
- Tbd.

## Meetings
- Meetings were primarily in person, within study rooms. Those that could not attend would communicate through Facebook messenger. Meetings were also held
inside a group chat within Facebook messenger where less important decisions were made.
- Weekly meetings occured on Wednesday mornings, in addition to two key decision making meetings.

## Lessons
- Creating meeting goals for future meetings will help keep the team focused and better map out progress.
