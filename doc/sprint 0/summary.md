Arduino based plant maintanence system

An arduino powered device which measures the humidity of a flower plant and releases a valve to water it.

Project Objective: We are going to create an arduino based plant management system. It will automatically detect moisture levels in the soil and water the plants appropriately. It will also measure temperature, humidity, and make suggestions. It will keep track of data about the plants such as when it was watered, sunlight levels, age and allow users to input their own data too. We will be able to present the data back to the User, and make graphs to help visualize the data too. Also, it will have a software component where we can control remotely, for manual watering, graphs, tracking, (ex. how much water it got) 

Key Users:
- Beginners:
  Want to start learning about plants and growing their own
  
- Busy People (due to work, travel):
  Want to have plants within their household, but aren't always available to maintain them due to being busy
  
- Elderly people:
  Want to have plants within their household, but aren't always able to maintain them due to physical or mental limitations
  
- Lazy People:
  Want plants but don't want to care for them
  
- Handicapped People:
  Want plants but can't maintain them due to physical limitation
  
- Small Local Businesses (for decoration as an alternative to fake plants):
  Want to make their business look better and more environmentally friendly, so instead of using fake plants, they use real ones
  with this system to maintain them.
 
Principles: Minimal user interaction, plug and play

Materials:
valve
sunlight sensor
humidity sensor
moisture sensor
temperature sensor
arduino
wifi module
water tank
led to say if its on or not
water level sensor (maybe)

Technology we will be using:
sql
android(maybe)
php
html/css
C (for arduino)

Extra features: (after finishing main part):
app
scarecrow for birds or squirrels
