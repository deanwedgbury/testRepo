We started our Sprint Planning meeting Friday at 12 pm. It was held in the private rooms in Kaneff, everyone in the group attended and was on time. 

We spent the meeting deciding on which user stories to add to this sprint, we ended up choosing to choose the user stories: 

As a (person who likes to keep track of things and see progress), I would like to track how much sunlight/temperature/humidity my plant is getting so that I can determine if I should move it. [5/21]<br />
As a detail oriented person, I want to be able to water my plant manually, with the press of a button, so that I can control exactly when I water my plant. [1/8]<br />
As a frequent traveller, I want to have my plant automatically watered based on what is best for the plant, so that I can travel without worrying about my plants. [1/13]<br />
As a plant enthusiast, I want to store and retrieve relevant data on my plants so that I can keep track of my plants and take better care of it. [1/13]<br />

Which is basically being able to measure the temperature, humidity, and moisture, additionally watering the plant at certain moisture levels, and storing this measured data in a database.

We only started 4 user stories, not all the user stories. This is because some of the user stories depend on these four and we need to finish these first. We also could not fit every user story into this sprint.
