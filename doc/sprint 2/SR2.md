## Practices to Keep
Working on the website as a group is more efficient than assigning tasks and expecting everyone to understand what the other parts of the website will do. Lots of work is dependant on other work so communication is crucial and having one instance of the website running is better than each of us having our own instance of the website.

## Practices to Add
Setting up expectations for what a part of the website will do would make it easier for us to understand what we're aiming at instead of just assuming that we all have the same implementation in mind.
