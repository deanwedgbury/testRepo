## Practices to Keep
Keeping good communicaiton allows us to make rapid changes that might work better for our project without worrying about it breaking other people's work.

## Practices to Add
Setting up expectations for timelines of when things will be done as opposed to just working on it until its done.

## Practices to Purge
Making last minute changes without consulting the entire team.

## Best/Worst Experience
- Seeing the graph update automatically and making it visually appealing.
- Too many components running simultaneously causing the motor to not receive enough power.
